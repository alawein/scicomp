## Physics-Informed Neural Networks
### Theoretical Foundation
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws directly into the learning process by incorporating differential equations as soft constraints in the loss function.
**Core Principle**: Minimize a composite loss function:
```
L = L_data + λ_physics * L_physics + λ_boundary * L_boundary
```
where:
- L_data: Data fitting loss
- L_physics: Physics constraint violation
- L_boundary: Boundary condition satisfaction
### Universal Approximation Theorem
**Theorem**: A feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on compact subsets of ℝⁿ to arbitrary accuracy.
**Mathematical Formulation**:
For any continuous function f: [0,1]ⁿ → ℝ and ε > 0, there exists a neural network F_N such that:
```
sup_{x∈[0,1]ⁿ} |f(x) - F_N(x)| < ε
```
### PINN Architecture
**Network Approximation**:
```
u_θ(x,t) = NN_θ(x,t)
```
**Physics Residual**:
```
r(x,t) = ∂u_θ/∂t + N[u_θ] - f(x,t)
```
where N[·] is the differential operator and f(x,t) is the source term.
**Automatic Differentiation**: Enables exact computation of derivatives through computational graphs.
### Loss Function Components
**Physics Loss**:
```
L_physics = 1/N_p Σᵢ |r(xᵢ,tᵢ)|²
```
**Boundary Loss**:
```
L_boundary = 1/N_b Σⱼ |B[u_θ](xⱼ,tⱼ) - g(xⱼ,tⱼ)|²
```
**Initial Condition Loss**:
```
L_initial = 1/N_0 Σₖ |u_θ(xₖ,0) - u₀(xₖ)|²
```
### Schrödinger PINN
**Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation**:
```
iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = -ℏ²/2m ∇²ψ + V(x)ψ
```
**Complex-Valued Networks**: ψ_θ(x,t) = u_θ(x,t) + iv_θ(x,t)
**Physics Residual**:
```
r = iℏ ∂ψ_θ/∂t + ℏ²/2m ∇²ψ_θ - V(x)ψ_θ
```
**Conservation Laws**:
- Probability: ∫|ψ|²dx = 1
- Energy: ⟨ψ|Ĥ|ψ⟩ = constant
### Navier-Stokes PINN
**Incompressible Flow Equations**:
```
∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = -∇p/ρ + ν∇²u + f
∇·u = 0
```
**Velocity-Pressure Formulation**:
```
u_θ(x,y,t) = [u_x(x,y,t), u_y(x,y,t)]
p_θ(x,y,t) = p(x,y,t)
```
**Reynolds Number**: Re = UL/ν (characteristic velocity × length / kinematic viscosity)
**Physics Residuals**:
```
r_momentum = ∂u_θ/∂t + (u_θ·∇)u_θ + ∇p_θ/ρ - ν∇²u_θ - f
r_continuity = ∇·u_θ
```
### Elasticity PINN
**Linear Elasticity Equations**:
```
∇·σ + b = 0 (equilibrium)
σ = C:ε (constitutive)
ε = ½(∇u + (∇u)ᵀ) (kinematic)
```
**Displacement Field**: u_θ(x,y) = [u_x(x,y), u_y(x,y)]
**Stress-Strain Relations** (plane stress):
```
[σₓₓ]   E/(1-ν²) [1  ν  0    ] [εₓₓ]
[σᵧᵧ] = --------- [ν  1  0    ] [εᵧᵧ]
[σₓᵧ]             [0  0  (1-ν)/2] [γₓᵧ]
```
### Training Strategies
**Adaptive Weights**: Dynamically balance loss components
```
λᵢ(epoch) = λᵢ⁽⁰⁾ * (Lᵢ⁽⁰⁾/Lᵢ(epoch))^α
```
**Curriculum Learning**: Gradually increase problem complexity
**Transfer Learning**: Pre-train on simpler problems, fine-tune on complex ones

## Neural Operators
### Operator Learning Theory
**Operator**: Mapping between function spaces G: U → V
- U: Input function space
- V: Output function space
**Goal**: Learn the operator G from input-output pairs {uᵢ, G(uᵢ)}
### Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)
**Architecture**: Combines local and global transformations
**Fourier Transform**: F[u](k) = ∫ u(x)e^(-2πikx)dx
**Fourier Layer**:
```
(K(u))(x) = F⁻¹(R_θ · F[u])
```
where R_θ is a learnable weight matrix in Fourier space.
**Complete FNO Layer**:
```
v_{l+1} = σ(W_{l+1}v_l + K_l(v_l))
```
**Key Properties**:
- Resolution invariant
- Efficient in Fourier domain
- Captures global dependencies
**Approximation Theory**: FNO can approximate any nonlinear operator with sufficient width and depth.
### DeepONet Architecture
**Branch-Trunk Decomposition**:
```
G(u)(y) ≈ Σᵢ bᵢ(u) · tᵢ(y)
```
**Branch Network**: B(u) = [b₁(u), b₂(u), ..., bₚ(u)]
- Input: Function u evaluated at sensor points
- Output: p-dimensional basis coefficients
**Trunk Network**: T(y) = [t₁(y), t₂(y), ..., tₚ(y)]
- Input: Query coordinates y
- Output: p-dimensional basis functions
**Final Output**:
```
G_θ(u)(y) = B_θ(u) · T_θ(y) + b₀
```
**Universal Approximation**: DeepONet can approximate any nonlinear operator to arbitrary accuracy.
### Operator Approximation Theory
**Rademacher Complexity**: Bounds generalization error for operator learning:
```
R_n(F) = E_σ[sup_{G∈F} 1/n Σᵢ σᵢG(uᵢ)(yᵢ)]
```
**Approximation Error**: How well the architecture can represent the true operator
**Generalization Error**: How well the trained model performs on unseen data

## Deep Learning Theory
### Optimization Landscape
**Loss Surface**: Non-convex optimization landscape with multiple local minima
**Gradient Descent Dynamics**:

θ_{k+1} = θ_k - η∇L(θ_k)
```
**Adam Optimizer**: Adaptive moment estimation
```
m_k = β₁m_{k-1} + (1-β₁)∇L(θ_k)
m̂_k = m_k/(1-β₁^k)
v_k = β₂v_{k-1} + (1-β₂)(∇L(θ_k))²
v̂_k = v_k/(1-β₂^k)
θ_{k+1} = θ_k - η m̂_k/(√v̂_k + ε)
```
### Generalization Theory
**PAC-Bayes Bounds**: Relate generalization to network complexity
**Lottery Ticket Hypothesis**: Sparse subnetworks exist that can be trained in isolation
**Double Descent**: Test error decreases, increases, then decreases again with model complexity
### Regularization Techniques
**Weight Decay**: L₂ penalty on parameters
```
L_total = L_data + λ||θ||²
```
**Dropout**: Randomly set neurons to zero during training
**Batch Normalization**: Normalize layer inputs
```
BN(x) = γ((x-μ)/σ) + β
```
**Early Stopping**: Stop training when validation error starts increasing

## Optimization in Physics
### Physics-Constrained Optimization
**Constrained Problem**:
```

subject to g(x) = 0 (physics constraints)
           h(x) ≤ 0 (inequality constraints)
```
**Lagrangian Formulation**:
```
L(x,λ,μ) = f(x) + λᵀg(x) + μᵀh(x)
```

```
### Inverse Problems

L_ELBO = E_q[log p(D|θ)] - KL(q_φ(θ)||p(θ))
```
### Monte Carlo Dropout
**Training**: Apply dropout with probability p
**Inference**: Apply dropout T times, compute mean and variance:
```
μ(x) = 1/T Σₜ f_θₜ(x)
σ²(x) = 1/T Σₜ (f_θₜ(x) - μ(x))²
```
### Ensemble Methods
**Deep Ensembles**: Train multiple models with different initializations
```
μ_ensemble = 1/M Σₘ μₘ
σ²_ensemble = 1/M Σₘ (σ²ₘ + μₘ²) - μ²_ensemble
```
